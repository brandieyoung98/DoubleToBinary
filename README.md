# DoubleToBinary
Solution to the following problem (Cracking the Coding Interview, 5.2):  Given a real number between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.72) that is passed in as a double, print the binary representation. If the number cannot be represented accurately in binary with at most 32 characters, print "ERROR:' 
Note that I expanded my solution such that I converted any double in general (not just those between 0 and 1) to binary, if the number of digits after the decimal place was 32 or less.
